- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @silteliz
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in using quantitative methods and coding to solve social science questions, such as:
  - How does the media portray minorities?
  - What is the nature of discussions about race and skin color in the internet?
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python and machine learning.
